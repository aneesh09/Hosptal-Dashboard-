Monthly Analysis: April 2023 vs December 2023

📈 Objective
To compare key ER performance indicators across two months and derive insights for improving patient care, satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

🔍 Key Findings
1. Patient Volume & Wait Time
April: 479 patients | Avg Wait Time: 34.9 mins

December: 489 patients | Avg Wait Time: 34.8 mins
✅ Patient flow remained consistent with marginal improvement in wait times.

2. Patient Satisfaction
April Score: 5.30

December Score: 4.68
📉 Despite improved wait times, satisfaction decreased—suggesting other influencing factors like service quality or communication.

3. Admission & Referral Trends
Admission rate increased: 49.5% → 51.1%

Fewer patients referred to specialists in December; more resolved via General Practice or self-care.

4. Demographic Patterns
Gender distribution balanced (~50/50 in both months)

December saw increased diversity (more African American & Native American patients)

Shift in age group: Higher footfall in 30–59 age range in December.

5. Peak Hours & Days
April Peak: Saturday evenings (8–9 PM)

December Peak: Friday afternoons (2–3 PM)
📌 December required greater mid-day staffing; shift from evening surges to afternoon rush.

✅ Recommendations
Investigate satisfaction drivers beyond wait time (e.g., communication, facilities, staff courtesy).

Reallocate staff to cover high-demand slots—particularly Friday afternoons.

Monitor diversity trends to improve inclusivity and culturally responsive care.

Analyze rise in self-managed cases for potential triage or education opportunities.
