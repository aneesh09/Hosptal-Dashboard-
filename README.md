December: 489 patients | Avg Wait Time: 34.8 mins
✅ Patient flow remained consistent with marginal improvement in wait times.

2. Patient Satisfaction
April Score: 5.30

December Score: 4.68
📉 Despite improved wait times, satisfaction decreased—suggesting other influencing factors like service quality or communication.

3. Admission & Referral Trends

Shift in age group: Higher footfall in 30–59 age range in December.

5. Peak Hours & Days
April Peak: Saturday evenings (8–9 PM)

📌 December required greater mid-day staffing; shift from evening surges to afternoon rush.

✅ Recommendations
Investigate satisfaction drivers beyond wait time (e.g., communication, facilities, staff courtesy).

Reallocate staff to cover high-demand slots—particularly Friday afternoons.

Monitor diversity trends to improve inclusivity and culturally responsive care.

Analyze rise in self-managed cases for potential triage or education opportunities.
